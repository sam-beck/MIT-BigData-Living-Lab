# CoT_model_basic
- Commenced: 6/1/25
- Concluded: TBD

## Overview
The first project involved investigating into how a chain of thought (CoT) large language model (LLM) could be implemented. The programming language to be used is python as it is a well known language that has a plethora of libraries and api for training and using large language models along with the HuggingFace library. The sub-project consists of a large language CoT model pipeline utilising pytorch, along with a traning and inference process that has been optimised with parallel sampling.
