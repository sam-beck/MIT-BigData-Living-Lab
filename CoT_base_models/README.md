# CoT_model_basic
- Commenced: 26/1/25
- Concluded: TBD

## Overview
Upon researching and learning about large language models, their implementation in python and chain of thought architecture, the next step was to find open-source CoT LLMs to then be used in an inference endpoint for ease of access. Furthermore, thought into training such models and datasets is also to be considered.
