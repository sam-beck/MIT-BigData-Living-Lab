# MIT-BigData-Living-Lab

## Internship Details
The MIT BigData Living Lab Summer Internship is a partnership summer internship between [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/) and [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/), focusing on the safe and ethical use of data in artificial intelligence applications.

## Project Details
The project entails research into the implementation of a ***chain of thought*** (CoT) large language model (LLM) capable of answering more complex questions through the use of backtracking / thought path lookup to influence the final output to a multi-staged or difficult to answer prompt based on the provided information.

Different structures of the model will be investigated and put into practice to be analysed and benchmarked against other competing models to quantify the effectiveness of chain of thought in LLMs.

## Contents
Each folder represents a research / practical venture during the internship, with a brief description of the tasks, outcomes and learned experience or information obtained by the research or implementation.
